How to configure postfix on a server (allows sending mail via the tool 'sendmail' which is in use by PHP as well):
====================================================================================================================

* install postfix (if not already installed...use the next step to check status)


* edit postfix config file /etc/postfix/main.cf


* setup the following parameters:


	# from whom 

	myhostname = mail.co.il

	# which server to use for sending mails (mail relay)

	relayhost = 192.168.1.1

	# disable ipv6 (change the default value which is set on 'all')

	inet_protocols = ipv4
	
	# check the mydestination parameter (must be empty):
	
	mydestination = 


* restart postfix:

	/etc/init.d/postfix restart



* test mail delivery:

	via sendmail:

		sendmail user@mail.co.il < file-to-send.txt

		Notes:

			* If the file has dots (.) in it, add the -i switch to ignore them (otherwise the dot will end the data 
			stream - see SMTP protocol details.)
			* In this example, the content of the file "file-to-send.txt" will be sent as a letter CONTENT rather than
			an attached file (so the "txt" suffix is NOT required here).
			* to make the sent mail a bit more aesthetic, one can add the following lines at the top of the file:

				from: user@mail.co.il
				
to: user@mail.co.il
				subject: mySubject

	via php:

		php -r "mail('user@mail.co.il','subject','body');"


	Conditions:
		
		* If a file is being sent, it MUST have ".txt" suffix OR it MUST be a zipped file WITH a password.


* check the logs for a healthy process:

	tail /var/log/maillog


	Notes:

		* if the log shows the word "queued", it means that the mail was successfully sent to the SMTP server and it is 
		waiting for its turn to be sent.

		* if the word "removed" is shown AFTER the word "queued" that's OK too and it is NOT an error.
		
		* if there is an error, make sure that the sender name is <some-random-number>@mail.co.il and NOT
		 <some-random-number>@<some-domain>.mail.co.il. If it is the latter, it means that the field "myhostname"
		 explained above has a WRONG value and needs to be corrected (NO postfix service restart is needed after the update).


* DEBUG via telnet:

	* if there are still problems with sending the mail via a mail client, try using the SMTP protocol DIRECTLY via TELNET
	 like so (type the following EXACTLY as-is one by one [WITHOUT the arrows ...]):

		-> telnet <smtp-server-ip> 25
		
			-> if this fails you have a network problem ...

		-> ehlo myserver.mail.co.il

		-> mail from: myserver@mail.co.il

		-> rcpt to: user@mail.co.il, someone-else@mail.co.il (replace with your actual recipient name(s))

		-> to write the message, type "data"

		-> after that set a subject by writing:
		
			Subject: My Telnet Test Email
		
		-> type the letter itself (letter content): 
		
			Hello,

			This is an email sent by using the telnet command.

			Your friend,
			
			Me
		
		-> when done, type a dot (.) once FOLLOWED by ENTER:
			
			.

		-> at this point the letter will be queued at the SMTP server

			-> type "quit" to exit telnet.
