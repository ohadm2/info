-------------------

1. enable core dumps:

     ulimit -c unlimited
     
     verify:
             ulimit -c
             
             (a '0' as an answer means: NOT enabled)
             
2. generate the core dump by running the crashing program

3. cores are located at:  /var/crash/ 
  
    -> the .crash files are text files. you can view them with a normat text editor also

4. install core dumps analyzer 'apport-retrace':

    sudo apt install apport-retrace

5. edit the crash file and add a new "Package" line at the start of it

  -> sudo nano _usr_bin_sudo.0.crash
  
    add the line 'Package: sudo' at the top of the file and save it

6. run the dumps analyzer 'apport-retrace' along with gdb:

    sudo apport-retrace -g _usr_bin_sudo.0.crash
    
7. analyze ...
